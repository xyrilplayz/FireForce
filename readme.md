# FireApp

A simple app that monitors fire incidents from different cities and countries.

### Instructions

1. Create a Repository on GitHub:

- Log in to your GitHub account.
- Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the page and select "New repository."
- Enter a name for your repository, choose any other settings you want, and click "Create repository."

2. Clone the Repository Locally:

- Once the repository is created, you'll see a green "Code" button. Click on it.
- Copy the URL provided (it should end with .git).
- Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
- Run the following command, replacing <repository_URL> with the URL you copied:

```
git clone <repository_URL>
```

3. Clone the Content of the Boilerplate:

- Navigate into the cloned repository directory:

```
cd <repository_name>
```

- Now, clone the content of the boilerplate into this directory. If you have the URL for the boilerplate repository, you can use the following command:

```
git clone <boilerplate_repository_URL>
```

- Replace <boilerplate_repository_URL> with the URL of the boilerplate repository.

If you don't have the URL for the boilerplate repository, you can download the content as a ZIP file from the boilerplate repository on GitHub. Once downloaded, extract the contents into your local repository directory.

4. Install Required Dependencies:

- Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your machine.
- Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of your local repository.
